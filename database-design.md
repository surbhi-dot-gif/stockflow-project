1. The Schema (SQL Design)companies: id, name, created_atwarehouses: id, company_id (FK), name, locationsuppliers: id, company_id (FK), name, contact_emailproducts: id, company_id (FK), name, sku (Unique), price (Decimal), low_stock_thresholdinventory: id, product_id (FK), warehouse_id (FK), quantityinventory_logs: id, inventory_id (FK), change_amount, reason (e.g., 'sale', 'restock'), timestampbundles: id, parent_product_id (FK), child_product_id (FK), quantity_needed
2. Gaps & Questions for the Product TeamCurrency: Do we support multiple currencies for price?Bundle Logic: If a bundle is sold, does the inventory of the individual components automatically decrease?User Permissions: Should certain users only see specific warehouses?
3. Decisions ExplainedDecimals for Price: Never use Floats for money due to rounding errors ($0.1 + $0.2 \neq 0.3$ in float logic).Inventory Logs: Instead of just updating the quantity, we track every change. This is vital for B2B audits.Foreign Keys (FK): These ensure that you can't delete a warehouse if there is still stock listed inside it.
